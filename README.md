## üöÄ Projects
- **[Telegram Bot for Foodsharing Hackathon](https://github.com/nurgalive/Foodsharing_SDD)**: Developed a Telegram bot during a hackathon to streamline foodsharing activities. The bot monitors and retrieves new foodsharing postings from various platforms, automatically sharing them in a Telegram chat. It includes advanced filtering capabilities using morphological analysis to categorize and prioritize ads based on user preferences.
- **[Algorithms and Data Structures](https://github.com/nurgalive/algorithms-and-data-structures)**: This repository showcases my implementations of various algorithms and data structures built from scratch. It also includes solutions to a wide range of algorithmic problems, demonstrating problem-solving techniques and optimization strategies.
- **[NurgaPy](https://github.com/nurgalive/nurgapy)**: This project is a utility library containing reusable functions that I frequently use across various projects. It may also prove helpful in your own work! Currently, the library includes: A function wrapper for measuring execution time, a lightweight, dependency-free progress bar. More features may be added over time to address common development needs.
- **[Ora2pg scripts](https://github.com/nurgalive/ora2pg_scripts)**: This repository contains a set of scripts designed to streamline the use of ora2pg. Key features include: Filtering and removing unnecessary messages from the ora2pg output, supporting the generation and testing of import scripts, automating the execution of generated import scripts using Python, sorting and managing imported scripts based on execution results for better organization and workflow efficiency. These tools aim to simplify and enhance the database migration process.
